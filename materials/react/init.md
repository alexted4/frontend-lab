# Getting Started

First step is to set up your environment

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
- Use [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) to install [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) as a global package
- Init a project using ⬆️ CRA ⬆️ inside _YOUR_REPO/workflow/react-project_
- Launch it to be sure it works
- Enjoy yourself a little bit 💪
- Add your first component called _CurrentTime_, which displays the current time(HH:MM:SS format), time should be updated every second
- Place _\<CurrentTime \/\>_ somewhere inside of default _\<App \/\>_ component (ensure it is visible)
- Great job! 🎉🎊 You have your own React project running! See [the next task](./first_steps.md)

Here there's a presentation about [SPA, basic React things](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UaNvPMyGPhCgi4rB8ht7jzzlkatqV73p/view) Read It!

💡 Tip: read articles about organizing directory structure of React projects and decide how it will looks.
