# First steps 🍹

Lets add some content to our default page.<br/>
Here there's [THE DESIGN](https://www.figma.com/file/4fBQwJEhbdymhAiRfmOp7m/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1) of our first page. Here is Sign up to the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to have an access to the template. Ask your mentor about any issues with this.

- First of all remove all the default content from the _\<App \/\>_ component.
- Our app will be called "Cocktail App", so let's rename the site title (if you have more graceful name be free to name differently 👌🏼).
- Start creating the 1st page - Home:
  - think ahead and make some of the components reusable, configurable
  - left side quotes should be animated (it should scrolls verticaly in the loop, automaticaly). Find quates by yourself, amount of them should be 3 or more ([example](./vertical_scroll_expample.gif))
  - right side image is clickable, so make it open modal (for now just blank one)
  - Get Started button also should open blank modal for now
  - user have to be able close modal by click on close button or outside of the modal
  - use Font Awesome icons

❗️❗️❗️ Make all pages responsive.
