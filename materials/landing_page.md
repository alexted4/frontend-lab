# Landing Page

<div style="float: right" align="center">
  <img src="../assets/responsive-landing.svg" width="500">
</div>

The task is pretty obvious. It's just for slow start for you 😉.<br/>
So you need to create Landing Page which will looks and behave like this one:
<a target="_blank" href="https://itechart-interns-landing.herokuapp.com/" rel="noopener">Here is the url</a> - may need some time to be loaded.

### The requirements for the task:

- write on plenty HTML, CSS, JS (withount any libraries/frameworks)
- the page should be fully responsive like in the example
- for the cards in the section <em>AND HERE ARE SOME IMAGES FOR YOU</em> use `flex`
- images can take from the example
- use `Roboto Slab` font famaly where it necessary (it's a custom one)
- all animations should be done using ONLY CSS/JS
- JS have to be written on the latest standarts (ES6+)
- it should looks good in the latest version of moder browsers (at least Chrome, Firefox)
- go to `workflow` folder, create `landing-page` folder and work on it
- 📛 don't copy code of the example
